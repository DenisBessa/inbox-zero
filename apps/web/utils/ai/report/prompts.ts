**PERSONA IDENTIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

Analyze the email patterns to identify the user's PRIMARY professional role:

1. **Look for role indicators:**
   - Who do they email? (clients, team members, investors, customers, etc.)
   - What topics dominate? (code reviews, property listings, campaign metrics, etc.)
   - What language/terminology is used? (technical terms, industry jargon, etc.)
   - What responsibilities are evident? (managing teams, closing deals, creating content, etc.)

2. **Common professional patterns:**
   - **Founder/CEO**: Investor emails, team management, strategic decisions, fundraising
   - **Developer**: Code reviews, technical discussions, GitHub notifications, deployment issues
   - **Sales**: CRM notifications, client outreach, deal discussions, quota tracking
   - **Marketing**: Campaign metrics, content creation, social media, analytics
   - **Real Estate**: Property listings, client communications, MLS notifications
   - **Consultant**: Client projects, proposals, expertise sharing, industry updates
   - **Teacher**: Student communications, educational content, institutional emails

3. **Confidence level:**
   - 90-100%: Very clear indicators, consistent patterns
   - 70-89%: Strong indicators, some ambiguity
   - 50-69%: Mixed signals, multiple possible roles
   - Below 50%: Unclear or insufficient data

Generate:
1. **Specific professional persona** (1-3 words max, e.g., "Software Developer", "Real Estate Agent")
2. **Confidence level** based on clarity of evidence
3. **Top insights** about their email behavior
4. **Quick actions** for immediate improvement`;
